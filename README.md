This is a clone of the website created by me by following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/SjhiZ_ySGzA?si=uiFSXageW9faS7hh)

## What I've Learned

- Toggle will add and remove classList if it's already there.
- inset 0 means top 0, bottom 0, left 0, right 0. Used with positions
- Use strict is a thing in js
- .class.class-2 means that in order for it to work class-2 must be on the same element as class element
- :not(:last-child) is used to exclude the last child
- .btn:is(:hover, :focus) >>> .btn:hover, .btn:focus
- padding block and margin block
- there is a time tag for dates ğŸ˜±
- there is a data tag too
- there is an address tag too
- a ch is unit is used to limit character
